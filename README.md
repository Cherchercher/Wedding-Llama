about me and this app:  <br />
    &nbsp;I love both Art and Technology, therefore web development is the place that my interests and  propels to enhance my ability.  <br />
    &nbsp;In the past I mainly used pure html, css3 and bootstrap to create websites, though I also have experience designing relational database with sql and noSQL with mongoDB for my startup in smart travel planning.  <br/>
    &nbsp;This time I'm implementing Wedding Llamas with REACT, SASS and Webpeck, because I've always wanted to learn modern technologies. <br/>
   Although there was little time left when I finished the other challenge, I decided to give it a shot. <br/>
    &nbsp;I suspects that the scale of this project is not complex enough to release the full potential of bundlers and javascript, but I've learned that it is easier to develop a Single Page App with, because it is object-oriented and modular, which I like. <br />
